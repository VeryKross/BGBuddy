# 3D Printable Case
This is a [very] basic case that I created to be 3D printed for BG Buddy. I should be printable without any supports on nearly any FDM (filament style) printer, and it will work equally well with PLA, PETG or whatever your favorite filament type is.

The case is a snap together design that doesn't require any glue other than the hot glue you might use to mount the SOC and OLED screen.

In addition to the top and base of the case, I've also included a separate "frame" for the OLED - I found this to be the trickiest bit to design and so by providing it separately, I hope to make it easier for anyone else who might want to use this frame within their own case design just to save some time and trouble. If you just want the case as-is, just print the top and base and ignore the frame.

Here's a picture of the printed case using PLA with a .28 layer hight - it would come out much cleaner if you print at higher quality setting.

If you are using the IdeaSpark "all in one" processor, the one with the ESP8266 and OLED mounted together as one unit, I've uploaded a new case that works well for it. Just download and print the three IdeaSparkCase files - they don't require any supports for printing. When operating, the blue activity LED is just visible through the plastic in the top-right corner (depending on what color filament you use of course).
