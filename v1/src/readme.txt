This folder contains the BG Buddy v1 source file. It can be loaded directly into 
the Arduino IDE, compiled, and flashed to your ESP8266 processor without making any changes.

NOTE: If building BG Buddy yourself, make sure that the esp8266 package under the Arduino IDE Boards Manager is set to version 3.0.2. Do NOT upgrade to version 3.1.x as this currently has issues that breaks our API access.
