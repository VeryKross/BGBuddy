The bin file here is a compiled version of the program in the src folder.

*NOTE*: The IdeaSpark version is only for the IdeaSpark ESP8266 with built-in OLED screen. Don't use this if building the project from the documentation with the separate ESP8266 and SSD1306 OLED components.

To install the bin file into your ESP8266 processor, use a ROM "flasher"
like the one from ESPHome Flasher: https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases
