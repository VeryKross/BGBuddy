The bin file here is a compiled version of the program in the src folder.

To install the bin file into your ESP8266 processor, use a ROM "flasher"
like the one from ESPHome Flasher: https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases

Note: The v1.2 binary adds support for displaying the BG Delta value at the bottom of the screen if pump information isn't available. This functionality is automatic and is not yet reflected in the posted source code (which is still v1.1). For the moment, this should be considered a test build.
